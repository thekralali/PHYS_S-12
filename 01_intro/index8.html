<h1> Week 8: </h1>
  <h3> Assignment </h3>
<p>Our assignment was to work on a circuit with any of the sensors in our kit (that we haven't already worked on) and produce an output of any sort. In the weekend, I spent my time researching projects preformed on Arduino using multiple sensors. My final project is a lazy susan, it doesn't need a lot of sensors to perform the functions I planned for it to do. That meant that I could be flexible with the assignment instead of catering it to suit my final project. It seemed like a great opportunity to do something new, so I decided to use a thermistor to tell the temperature of my room. I built a simple 5.5 volt circuit with a thermistor and a 1000 Î© resistor.</p>

<p?I placed a wire between them that connected to pin A0 so I could see the results show up on Arduino's serial monitor every half a second.</p>

<p>The digits that showed up were really close to the temperature I set my air conditioner on!</p>
