<h1> Week 2: </h1>
<h3> Unpacking kits </h3>
<p>
  We unpacked the kits we were sent earlier in June. We were given a brief explanation on the contents of the box and how to use a few tools. Didn't take too long though, our instructors told us we'd get a more detailed explanation on the electric components next week.

<h3> Laser Cutting and 2D Modelling </h3>
  <p>
    We spent most of our time at class that day learning how 2D laser machines worked and being walked through the safety measures necessary for the smoothest experience possible, such as making sure to prevent chemical exposure and power overload since it might start a fire. We were also told to avoid cutting materials like PVC plastic and ABS plastic. This is because PVC plastic emits pure chlorine gas once exposed to the laser and ABS plastic releases cyanide gas. Here's a list of other materials we would want to avoid using a laser cutter on.  I learned that Inkscape and Gimp are great tools to create pictures for the vinyl cutter to print. I haven't tried them yet, but I plan to in the near future.
