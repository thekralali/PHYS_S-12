<h1> Week 2: </h1>
  <h3> Unpacking Kits </h3>
<p>
  We unpacked the kits we were sent earlier in June. We were given a brief explanation on the contents of the box and how to use a few tools. Didn't take too long though, our instructors told us we'd get a more detailed explanation on the electric components next week. Here's a spreadsheet of the contents of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOkFU6QEcLgvfiy9Vk4253hDgYmkfd4hihdjB9ccpeg/edit#gid=0">kit.</a>

<h3> Laser Cutting and 2D Modelling </h3>
  <p>
    We spent most of our time at class that day learning how 2D laser machines worked and being walked through the safety measures necessary for the smoothest experience possible, such as making sure to prevent chemical exposure and power overload since it might start a fire. We were also told to avoid cutting materials like PVC plastic and ABS plastic. This is because PVC plastic emits pure chlorine gas once exposed to the laser and ABS plastic releases cyanide gas. Here's a <a href="https://cpl.org/wp-content/uploads/NEVER-CUT-THESE-MATERIALS.pdf">list</a> of other materials we would want to avoid using a laser cutter on.  I learned that Inkscape and Gimp are great tools to create pictures for the vinyl cutter to print. I haven't tried them yet, but I plan to in the near future.

  <h3> Assignment: Fusion 360 and 3D Modeling </h3>
  <p>
    Our assignment was to measure 3 components from our kits and recreate them in Fusion 360. After watching a few videos from CAD CAM Tutorials on YouTube, I started to get used to the software. I wanted to start with something small, so I designed one of the M5X0.8 nuts first. I wanted to test my attention to detail after finishing the first assignment, so I designed one of the lego pieces. For the last component, I decided to design something outside of the kit. I wanted to focus more on the design factor, so it seemed like a great idea. I designed a candle holder my family keeps downstairs in the living room.
