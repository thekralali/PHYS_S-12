<h1> Week 3: </h1>
<h3> Circuits </h3>
<p>
This week we started working on hands-on assignments. We were given a brief introduction on microcontrollers and electronic components in general. Microcontrollers are basically small computers in the form of a single chip. We haven't built any circuit this week without relying on it in place of a battery.<br>
We quickly dived in and pulled out the necessary components from our kits to build our first circuit in class. We only used some wires, an LED light, a resistor, a multimeter, and a microcontroller. Our only objective was to make the light light up. Though we had to experiment with a few resistors in order to see which one was most suitable for our circuit. I used a 470 Ω resistor and found that it worked perfectly.

   We then used our Arduino software to make our LED light blink by choosing the "Blink" example offered by the program itself.

  <h3> Assignment </h3>
  <p>
  The first step of our assignment was to create a circuit and use the multimeter to measure the voltages. I built a circuit with two 1k Ω resistors to divide the voltage into two.

  The second step was to use Ohm's law to calculate the current through some part of the circuit. Ohm's law is V (voltage) = IR (current x resistance), where V (under the effect of the resistor) = 1.65 and R = 1000. The current was 1.65 / 1000 = 0.00165 A

  <p>
The third step was to simulate our circuit in Tinkercad to see if it matched our results. It was a nice break from trying to shove the wires into the breadboard.
