  <h1> Week 6:</h1>
  <h3>Assignment</h3>
  <p>The first part of our assignment this week was to design and prepare to print either a component for our final project or an object that wouldn't easily be created using subtractive methods (taking away from the material, rather than adding onto it). I knew I needed to design my circuit first to build the most imporant parts of my project. I hadn't begun on the circuit yet, so I decided to choose the latter option. I had already designed a candle holder from our living room, so I just opened it in PrusaSlicer. I was surprised to see out that it needs 4 hours and 26 minutes to be 3D printed!<p>

  <p>The second part of our assignment was to 3D scan an object from our mobile phones using a photogrammetry app. I picked out a small bottle of lotion I bought from The Body Shop because I wanted to see if the apps could pick up the details on the bottle's design. I tried out 4 apps in the following order: Photogrammetry, Patchy Scan 3D, Capture, and Qlone. The first two didn't work for me at all. I only wasted my time and energy trying to work through those two apps. Capture seemed to work, but would only let me use the back camera if I put in my email. It didn't really seem worth it. Qlone was my last option. I printed out a mat provided by the app and placed my  bottle on top of it. It took a long time to scan, but it worked out eventually. Here's the result:</p>

 <p>It looks a little wonky and bumpy. I had to do a few manual changes such as flattening the cap (the app made the cap pointy), but I was VERY amused and delighted to see that the app actually replicated the bottle's design pretty well! The app's delineation of the flowery patterns on the bottle made up for the time it took me to 3D scan it.</p>
