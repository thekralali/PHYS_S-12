<h1> Week 1: </h1>
<h3> GitHub and Coding </h3>
<p>
We were introduced to GitHub as a platform that could allow us to write and document our progress. In order to do this properly, we have to write our website's code. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but I managed. There are some mistakes, but here's the code used for the main page:

<h3> Assignment </h3>
<p>
Our assignment was to work on our website and read the first 3 chapters of Dustyn Roberts' "Making Things Move" . The book was useful and very easy to understand. I'd recommend it to anyone who's mildly interested in architecture and/or engineering. I found the second chapter "Materials: How to Choose and Where to Find Them" most interesting. Learning about materials gave me a clearer image on how my invention was supposed to look like. The writer goes into details such as yield strength and the types of stresses some objects can handle. She also provides incredible sources for those who want to dive deeper into the subject. Here's a link to the book.
