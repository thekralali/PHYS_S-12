<h1> Digital Fabrication Documentation </h1>
<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>
My name is Thekra Alali. I'm a rising junior living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In my free time, I like to read historical articles and write scripts for video games that my friends and I create. My interest in digital fabrication began to bloom when I realized how flexible and useful it could be. There's no limit to what you could do after mastering digital fabrication. No one can deny that it's a field that combines convenience and creativity, two things I value to no end. This website is meant to document and store my ideas and process on a final project for Harvard's PHYS S-12 "Introduction to Digital Fabrication" course.

<h3> Ideas so far: </h3>
<p>
  - A bunkbed that could turn into a desk or a shelf by the control of a remote. <br>
<br>
- A device that could sort out the contents of a dishwasher automatically by identifying the objects and knowing where to place them. The least its supposed to do is pick up a wet plate without dropping it and placing it into its correct slot.<br>
<br>
- A device that could help open an iPhone without facial recognition technology or having to put in a password. In Saudi Arabia, it's very common to see women wearing niqab. Niqab is a cloth that covers the entire face, except for the eyes. Face ID doesn't work for these women when they're in public. So instead of having to type in their password every time, I'd like to find an easier way for them to unlock their phone.<br>
