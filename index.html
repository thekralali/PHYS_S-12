     <h5><a>About Me</a></h5>
      <p> My name is Thekra Alali. I'm a sophomore living in Saudi Arabia. This website is meant to document my ideas and process on Harvard's PHYS S-12 "Introduction to Digital Fabrication" course.</p>
      <p>Ideas so far:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><p style="font-size:20px">A bunkbed that could turn into a desk or a shelf by the control of a remote</li>
        <li><p style="font-size:20px">A device that could sort out the contents of a dishwasher automatically by identifying the objects and knowing where to place them.</li>
        <li><p style="font-size:20px">A device that could help open an iPhone without facial recognition technology or having to put in a password. In Saudi Arabia, it's very common to see women wearing niqab. Niqab is a cloth that covers the entire face, except for the eyes. Face ID doesn't work for these women when they're in public. So instead of having to type in their password every time, I'd like to find an easier way for them to unlock their phone.</li>
      </ul>
