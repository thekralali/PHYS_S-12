<h1> Digital Fabrication Documentation </h1>
<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>
My name is Thekra Alali. I'm a rising sophomore living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In my free time, I like to read historical articles and write scripts for video games that my friends and I create. My interest in digital fabrication began to bloom when I realized how flexible and useful it could be. There's no limit to what you could do after mastering digital fabrication. No one can deny that it's a field that combines convenience and creativity, two things I value to no end. This website is meant to document and store my ideas and process on a final project for Harvard's PHYS S-12 "Introduction to Digital Fabrication" course.
