# PHYS_S-12
My name is Thekra Alali. I'm a sophomore living in Saudi Arabia. This branch is meant to store and document my ideas for a final project in Harvard's PHYS S-12 "Introduction to Digital Fabrication" course.

Ideas so far:
- A bunkbed that could turn into a desk or a shelf by the control of a remote
- A device that could sort out the contents of a dishwasher automatically by identifying the objects and knowing where to place them.
